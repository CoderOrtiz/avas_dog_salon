## What I Learned:
1. In this project I practiced using Bootstrap and Font Awesome to gain additional experience before moving on the JavaScript. I am thankful I took on this additional project as I came across bugs I had not anticipated for and gained more experience debugging my code. 

2. This is the first project where I incorporated several of my own pages and hyperlinks, creating my first true website and not a webpage.

3. Practiced refactoring more code and implemented Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Code.

7. Lastly made a very responsive webpage and requested friends and family to attempt to find any issues. The google hyperlink was off center in mobile form and fixed. üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
